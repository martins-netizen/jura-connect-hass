"""Pure (framework-free) per-product brew-preference helpers.

A *brew preference* is the remembered strength / water / temperature /
grinder ratio / milk / milk-foam for a single product, keyed by the product's
hex Code (e.g. ``"03"``).
The on-disk / in-memory shape is::

    brew_prefs: dict[str, dict] = {
        "03": {"strength": 2, "water_ml": 130, "temp": None, "milk_s": None, "milk_foam_s": 12},
        ...
    }

``None`` for any parameter means **Factory Default**: send that product's
XML/factory default value (pass ``None`` to the ``jura_connect`` library's
``ProductDef.build_recipe_hex`` builder). It does NOT mean "use whatever the
machine currently has stored" — JURA WiFi exposes no such mechanism (truncated
start payloads are rejected and per-byte sentinels are taken literally), so we
always send an explicit, clamped value.

These helpers only manipulate plain JSON-safe dicts so they can be unit-tested
without Home Assistant or a Store, and reused by the coordinator (which adds
the actual persistence + staged-selection wiring on top).

All brew *protocol* logic — product tables, XML decoding, ``@TP:`` payload
construction — lives in the ``jura_connect`` backend library, not here. This
module only models the component's remembered-preference shape.
