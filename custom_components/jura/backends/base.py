"""Abstract backend interface for talking to a Jura machine.

A backend hides the synchronous nature of the ``jura_connect`` library
from the rest of the integration; concrete implementations are
responsible for marshalling blocking I/O onto a thread executor so the
coordinator/config-flow code stays naturally async.
